Installation
============

Extract the bmovie.tar.gz tarball using
LINUX/UNIX: tar xf bmovie.tar.gz
WINDOWS:    Winzip or anything like it

You get a directory called BMovieReviewer in the current directory (or whereever you extracted it to)

There are two possible distributions:

1. jar
	if you got this one, you are done
	
2. file system containing java sources
	Here, first you should build the binaries by typing
		ant
	A directory called 'build' is created and the entire distribution is stored within
	You could now change dirs into the 'build' directory and go on executing BMovieReviewer,
	or build a handy jar by typing
		ant jar
	Be aware, that the jar is built into the root directory of the distribution. If you move it, 
	be sure to move the 'dat/' subdirectory into the same folder. Otherwise, some functionality will
	be reduced.
	
	
Configuration
=============

There are several properties you would like to change like the server name the data is sent to
or the scripts on the server that are executed for sending it.

To do so, you must create a configuration file by invoking BMovieReviewer this way:
	bmovie --gcf > config.xml
where bmovie is the command to invoke BMovieReviewer which depends...

Then you can edit the file. 
NOTE: The file does not at all have to contain all possible keys. Missing ones are assigned standard values.

Conveniently, the configuration file has to be called config.xml and be within the current directory.
You can make BMovieReviewer use a different file by providing the -cfg - switch (See file Readme).
