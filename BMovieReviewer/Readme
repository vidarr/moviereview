Installation & configuration
============================

Refer to file INSTALL.


Execution
=========

General invocation is

	bmovie [options]

where bmovie is some kind of BMovieReviewer invocation.	
If a file is given, it is assumed to be a BMovieReviewer XML file and loaded.

If BMovieReviewer is invoked, following directories/jars should be within the class path:
.
[path_to_bmoviereviewer]
[path_to_bmoviereviewer]/lib/stax-utils.jar
[path_to_bmoviereviewer]/lib/jortho.jar

This is ensured if you rely on one of these methods of invocation:

  
Execution of jar 
================ 
To execute BMoviereviewer from a distributed jar, invoke java this way:
java -jar bmovie.jar 


Execution of .class-files
=========================
Go into [path_to_bmoviereviewer]/build and execute 
from linux/unix: ./bmovie (be sure to have the execution flag set, if in doubt, execute 'chmod 755 bmovie' first)
from windows   : Rely on the jar method 


Parameters
==========

-f --file [file]
----------------
Loads 'file' for editing

-gcf --generate-config-file
---------------------------
Prints a config.xml with standard settings to standard out

-cfg --config-file [file]
-------------------------
Loads settings from 'file' 

-dtd --print-bmovie-dtd
-----------------------
Prints DTD of the BMovieReviewer-XML format to standard-out

-xls --print-bmovie-xls
-----------------------
Prints XLS of the BMovieReviewer-XML format to standard-out
If the output sis saved to bmr.xls ,
you can view every saved xml with your browser as long as you keep the xls 
within the current directory

-ip --import-pdf [file]
-----------------------
Tries to import PDF 'file'  

-ep --export-pdf [file]
-------------------
Tries to export XML 'file' to PDF

-et --export-tex [file]
-------------------
Tries to export XML 'file' to TEX
 
-cp --convert-pdf [file]
------------------------
Tries to generate a XML file from PDF


Remark: All files are created either:
  * in the folder where the last xml was loaded from or stored to
  * or if there was no xml loading storing operation they are placed in the current one
There is ONE exception: If you export PDFs, they are always stored in the current folder, as 
BMR relies on pdflatex and it just behaves that way. One could move it for convenience or just leave it 
where it was put by elder forces...it's a 'tribute' to TeX ;)

Editing
=======

Editing "Wissenschaftliche/ logische/ technische Fehler/ Anmerkungen/ Handlung"
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In general, using line breaks is disabled. You can however use the following special signs (compare XHTML):
Line breaks: Type <br/>
Bullets:     Type <li/>  

For example:

"This is a small enumeration: <br/> <li/> Firstly <li/> Secondly/> "

will eventually create something like 

"This is a small Enumeration:
 * Firstly
 * Secondly"
